🚀 **Employee Performance Predictor**

**Welcome to the Employee Performance Predictor**! 🌟

This project is a machine learning tool that helps companies understand and predict employee performance. 
Instead of just guessing, we use data to figure out who is performing well and who might need a little extra support.

**What's Inside? **📦

**Smart Predictions**: We use advanced machine learning models (like XGBoost, which is our top performer!) to make accurate predictions.

**Easy to Use:** The project is built with Flask, so you can run it as a web application right from your computer.

**API Ready**: We've also created a simple API, which means other applications can easily use our prediction model.

**How to Get Started** 🏃‍♂️

**Install the Essentials**: Open your terminal and run this command to get all the necessary libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Run the App**: Start the Flask application with this command:

python app.py

**How the Magic Happens** 🧙‍♀️

**Our project goes through a few key steps to make sure we get the best possible prediction:**

**Data Prep**: We clean and organize the employee data to make it perfect for our models.

**Training**: We train different machine learning models to see which one performs the best. We track their performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score.

**Best Model**: Our tests showed that the XGBoost model is the most accurate, so that's the one we've chosen to use!

**Deployment**: We package the best model (best_model.pkl) and use Flask to make it available for real-time predictions.
